# 🧁 BakeBot

**BakeBot** is an AI-powered baking assistant that tells you whether your dessert recipe will work and what to fix if it won’t. Whether you're trying to make a protein cookie or a low-carb cake, BakeBot analyzes your ingredients and predicts whether the recipe will turn out with the right texture (cookie-like, cake-like, etc.).

## Features

- Input a custom list of ingredients
- Uses an LLM (GPT) to evaluate recipe success
- Falls back to a trained ML model if LLM is uncertain
- Provides explanations and suggestions for improvement
- Frontend + Flask backend architecture

## How It Works

1. User enters ingredients (e.g., "almond flour, maple syrup, egg")
2. BakeBot sends a prompt to the LLM asking if the recipe will turn out as a cookie
3. If the LLM returns low confidence or "unsure", the fallback ML model predicts the texture class
4. The backend returns:
   - A verdict (`"will bake as cookie"`)
   - An explanation (`"Has enough structure and binder"`)
   - The source (`"llm"` or `"ml"`)
